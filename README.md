Description:

This orginally was a lab managing app. An admin user can
create projects and assign tasks for that project to team members.

being originally made for laboratory work this alllowed for in depth information on the project
like sample types, tests to be ran, location , and number of samples.
this can be scaled up to manage any other projects by editing the forms and the name of columns in the database

*flow:*

After an admin user logs in they can decide to create user and projects.Once those two are create they can assign tasks 
by selecting the project and what the user who is assigned the task must do. all this can be done on the admin dashboard.

when a non-admin user signs in their home page has several information for them like total number of smaples assigned,tasks specifically assigned to them.
they can mark them complete or see more information on the task or the whole project. they can mark them complete after completed and that info is then 
reflected on the admin dashboard.
